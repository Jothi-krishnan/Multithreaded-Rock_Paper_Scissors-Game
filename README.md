# Multi-Threaded Rock Paper Scissors Game
## ACM Open Project - Summer 2022

I am Jothi Krishnan M, an ECE department sophomore of IIT Roorkee. This repository of mine is my submission to the ACM Open Project on the topic [Multi-Threaded Servers](https://hackmd.io/@node0/SyK5D0Dv9).

In this open project, I have used the concepts that have been taught to us over the span of 3 weeks about servers and threads to create a Muli-Threaded Rock Paper Scissors Game using python. In this game, a user can play with an opponent who is connected to our network and not necessarily on the same device that server is running.

## Overview

### Task Given
In this open project, we were taught about threads, servers and how to combine them to create a multithreaded server. By using this general idea of multi-threaded servers we were asked to create a use case for this multi-threaded server. This given project is language independent and allowed us to use any threaded library in our project. This projct needed to have a Mutex Lock in it as well.
### Description of my work
What better use case than a simple game can be implemented using the multi-threaded server. I have implemented a multi-server Rock Paper Scissors Game in python. This game will completely change the way you play the game Rock Paper Scissors game in your future. This allows players to join the server from different device that is connected to the same network and not necessarily on the same device as the server.
